# Z-Grid

This project is:

## Made with flexbox
- No weird floats
- Vertical alignment is trivial
- Horizontal alignment is trivial

## Browser support

z-grid is built using autoprefixer, which is configured to include css vendor prefixes that cover the last two editions of all browsers. 

<table width="100%" style="text-align: center;">

      <td>Firefox</td>
      <td>Chrome</td>
      <td>IE10+</td>
      <td>100% rad</td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
      <td>✔</td>
